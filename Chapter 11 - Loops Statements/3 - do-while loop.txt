The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the condition after executing the block of code. Therefore, the code inside the loop will always run at least once.

do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);


var i = 0;
do {
  print('Iteration $i');
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

output

Iteration 0
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
