for loop:
The for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}


for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print('Iteration $i');
}

output

Iteration 0
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
