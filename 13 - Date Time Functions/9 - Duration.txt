Duration: Dart's Duration class represents a span of time, allowing you to work with time intervals.

// Create a duration
Duration duration = Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 30);

// Adding a duration to a DateTime
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
DateTime futureDateTime = now.add(duration);

// Subtracting a duration from a DateTime
DateTime pastDateTime = now.subtract(duration);

// Difference between two DateTimes as a Duration
Duration difference = futureDateTime.difference(now);
