Date arithmetic: Dart's DateTime class allows you to perform various arithmetic operations on dates.

DateTime startDate = DateTime(2023, 7, 5);
DateTime endDate = DateTime(2023, 7, 15);

// Difference between two dates in days
int daysDifference = endDate.difference(startDate).inDays;

// Difference between two dates in hours
int hoursDifference = endDate.difference(startDate).inHours;

// Difference between two dates in minutes
int minutesDifference = endDate.difference(startDate).inMinutes;
