The fixed-length Lists are defined with the specified length. You cannot change the size at runtime. This will create List of 5 integers with the value 0.

void main() {  
   var list = List<int>.filled(5,0);  
   print(list);  
}

OUTPUT

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

 Info

Note: You cannot add a new item to Fixed Length List, but you can change the values of List.
